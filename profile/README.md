## About
This project is all about getting the GoXLR (and GoXLR mini) working properly on Linux. 
The [GoXLR-Utility](https://github.com/GoXLR-on-Linux/GoXLR-Utility) is used to configure the GoXLR and works also on other Unix systems such as macOS.
The main focus is on the last bits of the effects and the sampler now.
After that we will focus on a GUI application to get a better user experience,
also for users who have just switched to linux. The changeover should be as simple as possible.
